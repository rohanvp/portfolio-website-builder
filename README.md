# Portfolio Website

This is a Datbase driven Portfolio website Builder implemented using HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL. 

The website fetches user data from the database and displays on the website. Lowers website's content customization time significantly.

Steps to use the website:
1. Purchase a website hosting ( purchasing domain name is not necessary. Most web hosting platforms give free domain as well.)
2. Configure a database on the server using phpmyadmin (provided by hosting as well)
3. Create a new user in the database with limited privilages(website uses only select. So giving only SELECT privilage will suffice.)
4. Paste the relevent data into the dbconnect.php (this file makes connections to the database).
5. Paste your information actual database on the hosting platform.
6. Paste all the files (except .gitattributes and db folder) to the public_html folder of your hosting.
7. Your website is setup.
